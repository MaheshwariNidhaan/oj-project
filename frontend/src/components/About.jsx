        Webcode is an application for coding Geeks to try out new problems and
        keep track of who solves what. It is a portal for users to test their
        mettle on various coding problems, some of which may require users about
        their very basics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design of Webcode is clean and card-based, with a focus on
        user-interaction above everything else.
